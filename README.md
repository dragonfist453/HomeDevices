# Home Devices

This is an android app created by Ambu Karthik to control devices over local internet using Web API requests. 

A raspberry pi has been set up which hosts a flask server with which Relay module is controlled in accordance with Web requests. 
According to the query string for every app route, state of light is decided. 

This app is very simplistic as of now and has no extra features except for 7 switches to control specific set of lights
